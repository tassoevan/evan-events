Contributing to Evan Events
===========================

Feel free to contribute to Evan Events, but I strongly want to encourage you to
follow these guidelines.

GitHub
------

Fork the main repository and code in specific branches before you do a pull
request to the `develop` branch, **NEVER** in `master` branch. Actually I have
adopted the prefixes `feature-`, `fix-`, and `hotfix-` for my branches.

Composer
--------

Before you code anything, please run

```sh
$ composer install
```

to install locally the project dependencies.

Unit tests
----------

If you are writing a new feature, please write some unit tests for it.

Code Coverage
-------------

The unit tests must cover, at least, 70% of the code.

Code standard
-------------

This project follows the [PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).

Documentation
-------------

All autogenerated documentation is placed in `docs/` directory, not commited in
the repository.

Test, Sniff and Document
------------------------

There is a Composer script responsible to run unit tests, sniff code to validate
the code standard, and document everything:

```sh
$ composer test-sniff-doc
```
